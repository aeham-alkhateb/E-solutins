00:00.000 --> 00:01.601
Well you are a story teller

00:01.601 --> 00:03.103
You are a good story teller

00:03.103 --> 00:04.771
Depending on the song

00:04.771 --> 00:08.241
Umm, I kind of look at the songs
more like love letters

00:08.241 --> 00:10.043
Love letters?

00:10.043 --> 00:11.411
When did you write your first song?

00:11.411 --> 00:12.879
Remember?

00:12.879 --> 00:14.547
Yeah, I was probably

00:14.547 --> 00:17.784
Uh, I started writing songs

00:17.784 --> 00:19.519
Well, I thought they were songs anyway

00:19.519 --> 00:21.454
Probably when I was about 15

00:21.454 --> 00:23.156
When I was around 18

00:23.156 --> 00:26.860
I met up with a guy called Jim Vallance

00:26.860 --> 00:31.031
And he was able to structure,
help me structure ideas

00:31.031 --> 00:34.034
And teach me about the structure of song writing.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.070
And I think once I learnt that

00:37.070 --> 00:41.307
Because there is no master class for how
to write music

00:41.307 --> 00:43.376
You just have to,
it has got to be something you feel.

00:43.376 --> 00:47.480
And so if the reprise feels good

00:47.480 --> 00:48.948
you bring it back

00:48.948 --> 00:52.218
And that's more like what you call a chorus

00:52.218 --> 00:54.087
So it's just about how the structure

00:54.087 --> 00:56.890
so the song feels good as it sort of rambles on

00:56.890 --> 01:00.627
How did you get into music anyway?

01:00.627 --> 01:03.663
I got into music very very young

01:03.663 --> 01:06.599
Basically from hearing the music in my house.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.968
My father loves music

01:08.968 --> 01:11.604
and I used to belong to a thing called the

01:11.604 --> 01:13.339
Columbia Record Club

01:13.339 --> 01:15.775
You probably remember it

01:15.775 --> 01:17.610
and it basically what you do is

01:17.610 --> 01:21.581
is you buy a few records then

01:21.581 --> 01:22.882
and then they just give you a few records.

01:22.882 --> 01:23.850
Something like that.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.086
So I was like if you gonna get a few records

01:26.086 --> 01:27.420
Can I have one too?

01:27.420 --> 01:27.854
you know,

01:27.854 --> 01:30.123
And that's how I found out about a lot of groups.
