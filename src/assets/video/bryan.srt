1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,601
Well you are a story teller

2
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:03,103
You are a good story teller

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,771
Depending on the song

4
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,241
Umm, I kind of look at the songs
more like love letters

5
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,043
Love letters?

6
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,411
When did you write your first song?

7
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:12,879
Remember?

8
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,547
Yeah, I was probably

9
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:17,784
Uh, I started writing songs

10
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,519
Well, I thought they were songs anyway

11
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,454
Probably when I was about 15

12
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,156
When I was around 18

13
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,860
I met up with a guy called Jim Vallance

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,031
And he was able to structure, 
help me structure ideas

15
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,034
And teach me about the structure of song writing.

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,070
And I think once I learnt that

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:41,307
Because there is no master class for how
to write music

18
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,376
You just have to,
it has got to be something you feel.

19
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,480
And so if the reprise feels good

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,948
you bring it back

21
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:52,218
And that's more like what you call a chorus

22
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,087
So it's just about how the structure

23
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,890
so the song feels good as it sort of rambles on

24
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,627
How did you get into music anyway?

25
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,663
I got into music very very young

26
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,599
Basically from hearing the music in my house.

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,968
My father loves music

28
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,604
and I used to belong to a thing called the

29
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,339
Columbia Record Club

30
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,775
You probably remember it

31
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,610
and it basically what you do is 

32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,581
is you buy a few records then

33
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,882
and then they just give you a few records.

34
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:23,850
Something like that.

35
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,086
So I was like if you gonna get a few records

36
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,420
Can I have one too?

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,854
you know,

38
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,123
And that's how I found out about a lot of groups.
